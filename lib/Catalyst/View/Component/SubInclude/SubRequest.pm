Catalyst::View::Component::SubInclude::SubRequest - Sub-requests plugin for C::V::Component::SubInclude

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.07_03

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.07_03';
$VERSION = eval $VERSION;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your application class:

  package MyApp;

  use Catalyst qw/
    ConfigLoader
    Static::Simple
    ...
    SubRequest
  /;

In your view class:

  package MyApp::View::TT;
  use Moose;

  extends 'Catalyst::View::TT';
  with 'Catalyst::View::Component::SubInclude';

  __PACKAGE__->config( subinclude_plugin => 'SubRequest' );

Then, somewhere in your templates:

  [% subinclude('/my/widget') %]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Catalyst::View::Component::SubInclude::SubRequest> uses Catalyst sub-requests
to render the subinclude contents.

It requires L<Catalyst::Plugin::SubRequest>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<generate_subinclude( $c, $path, @args )>

This will make a sub-request call to the action specified by C<$path>. Note that
C<$path> should be the private action path - translation to the public path is
handled internally.

So, after path translation, the call will be (roughly) equivalent to:

  $c->sub_request( $translated_path, {}, @args );

Notice that the stash will be empty by default. This behavior is configurable
(see below).

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head2 keep_stash

You can choose to not localize the stash for SubRequests' subinclude calls. The subrequest
will have the same stash as the request that spawned it. Configure the keep_stash key
in your view:

    __PACKAGE__->config(
        subinclude => {
            'SubRequest' => {
                keep_stash => 1,
            },
        }
    );

Note: the stash that the subrequest receives is a shallow copy of the original stash. That
means that changes to values of keys on the first level of the stash will be lost when the
subrequest call returns. Don't count on this behaviour, as it may change in the future.

has keep_stash => (
    isa => Bool,

    default => 0,
);

sub generate_subinclude {
    my ($self, $c, $path, @params) = @_;
    my $stash = $self->keep_stash ? $c->stash : {};

    croak "subincludes through subrequests require Catalyst::Plugin::SubRequest"
        unless $c->can('sub_request');

    my $query = ref $params[-1] eq 'HASH' ? pop @params : {};

    my $action = blessed($path)
          ? $path
          : $c->dispatcher->get_action_by_path($path);

    my $uri = $c->uri_for( $action, @params );

    $c->sub_request( $uri->path, $stash, $query );
}
